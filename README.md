padavan-firmware-modify-tool
-----------------------------

This is someone else's work. Get it from there: <http://www.right.com.cn/forum/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=204663&highlight=%BD%E2%B0%FC>

But that guy didnt metion where it came from.

Padavan is an open-source, GPL licened router firmware, but there are people
who modified the project without open sourcing it. You can use this tool
to see what is changed.

If you know where this tool comes from, pls tell me <mailto:tylertempdev@gmail.com>

## Usage ##

extract: `modify.sh e firmware.trx`

re-create: `modify.sh c /path/to/unpacked/firmware/folder`
